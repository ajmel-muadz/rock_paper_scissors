Hello! This is my first ever proper website made by myself using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. I haven't optimised it for mobile (so far) so if you are playing on mobile the game might look a bit bad. I haven't learned much about responsive web design for the time being. Apologies for that.
